I'd like you to make the following enhancements:

* Move the GitHub API call to the server side.

* Create a new directorty called commands/ and add the following classes in this directory:
    * AbstractCommand class
    * AddCommand extends AbstractCommand
    * SortAscCommand extends AbstractCommand
    * RepoDescCommand extends AbstractCommand
	
* When a command is executed by a user, loop on the classes in the commands/ directory and check for a matching class, instantiate, execute and return results.

* Validation should happen within the command
